# JavaScript Guessing Game

> You know there are too many JS libraries when there is a game for it

## Description

React, Flux, Angular, Aurelia, TypeScript, Flow, oh my! By trying to make things simpler, I have created this game to stay on top of JavaScript in 2017.

[Play the game!](https://javascript-game.firebaseapp.com/)

![Demo](https://github.com/samiheikki/javascript-guessing-game/blob/master/static/og_image.jpg?raw=true)

Inspired by [How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.6m8kr3ema).

## Contributing

  1. Add a new object* of a JavaScript tool to [/static/logos.json](static/logos.json) JSON file.
  2. Add `100x100` .png image to `/static/logos/` directory with the tool's name in lowercase as the file's name.
  3. Create a pull request :)

* Object must contain required `name` and optional `repo`, `description` and `url` keys. Example:
```json 
{
  "name": "Vue",
  "repo": "vuejs/vue",
  "url": "https://vuejs.org",
  "description": "The Progressive JavaScript Framework"
}
```
