# JavaScript Guessing Game

> You don't know JavaScript

## Description

React, Flux, Angular, Aurelia, TypeScript, Flow, oh my! By trying to make things simpler, I have created this game to stay on top of JavaScript in 2016.

Inspired by [How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.6m8kr3ema).

## Contributing

  1. Add a new object of a JavaScript tool to `/static/logos.json` JSON file.
  2. Add `100x100` .png image to `/static/logos/` directory with the tool's name in lowercase as the file's name.
  3. Create a pull request :)

## Build Setup
